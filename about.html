    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a recent graduate in <strong>Nutrition and Food Science</strong> with a specialization in Nutrition and Wellness, 
      and currently pursuing a <strong>Master of Science in Engineering Management</strong> at Cumberland University. 
      I am deeply motivated by the intersection of science, management, and wellness — combining technical insight with human-centered care.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through my work as a <strong>Direct Support Personnel (DSP)</strong> at Homecare Preference LLC and True Vision Services Inc., 
      I developed individualized nutrition plans, promoted healthy habits, and supported individuals with disabilities in achieving 
      independence and comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to empower communities to embrace better health practices through evidence-based nutrition, 
      effective communication, and compassionate leadership.
